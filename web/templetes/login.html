<ul>
    <li><b>Game Rule</b>
        <ul>
            <li>You will play the role of either a parent or a child and complete the task with an AI partner in the complementary role.</li>
            <li>The parent need to find the lost child, and she can only see the child in a close range.</li>
            <li>The goal of the child is to effectively communicate its location so that the parent can travel to the lost child.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Procedure</b>
        <ul>
            <li>You will need to complete 20 trials as a parent and another 20 trials as a child.</li>
            <li>A trial begins with the parent and child spawned at random locations, and ends when the parent reaches to the same location with the child or exceeds maximum steps allowed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Communication Task</b>
        <ul>
            <li>In the communication panel, there are several tokens for the child to communicate its location to the parent.</li>
            <li>Each communication token refers to a specific location in the task environment.</li>
            <li>The child should select a token to inform the parent her location, and the parent should search for the child according to received token.</li>
            <li>Your task is to learn to use those tokens to collaborate with your AI partner in both parent and child roles.</li>
            <li>Your AI partner is trained to have a good understanding of those tokens, so you should be able to rely on its behavior to learn the communication.</li>
            <li>Your compensation is based on <b>task performance</b> (e.g. number of completed trials and steps taken in each trials).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Control</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Parent control: D - go right, A - go left, W - go up, S - go down.</li>
            <li>Child control: select communication contents using buttons on the right side.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<!--<h2>Game Rule</h2>-->
<!--<p>You will play the role of either a parent or a child and complete the task with an AI partner in the complementary role. </p>-->
<!--<p>The parent with a limited vision need to find a stationary child. </p>-->
<!--<p>The goal of the child is to effectively communicate its location so that the parent can travel to the lost child.</p>-->
<!--<h2>Procedure</h2>-->
<!--<p>You will need to complete 20 trials as a parent and 20 trials as a child. A trial begins with the parent and child spawned at random locations, and ends when the parent reaches to the child. </p>-->
<!--<h2>Communication Task</h2>-->
<!--<p>The child is allowed to send only one communication for each trial. Each communication token refers to a specific location in the task environment. Your task is to learn the semantic meanings of those tokens based the interaction with your AI partner.</p>-->
<!--<h2>Control</h2>-->
<!--<p>Parent control: D or right arrow - go right, A or left arrow - go left, W or up arrow - go up, S or down arrow - go down. Child control: select communication contents using buttons on the right side</p>-->
