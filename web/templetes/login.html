<ul>
    <li><b>Game Rule</b>
        <ul>
            <li>You will play the role of either a parent or a child and complete the task with an AI partner in the complementary role.</li>
            <li>The parent with a limited vision need to find a stationary child.</li>
            <li>The goal of the child is to effectively communicate its location so that the parent can travel to the lost child.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Procedure</b>
        <ul>
            <li>You will need to complete 20 trials as a parent and another 20 trials as a child.</li>
            <li>A trial begins with the parent and child spawned at random locations, and ends when the parent reaches to the child.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Communication Task</b>
        <ul>
            <li>The child is allowed to send only one communication for each trial.</li>
            <li>Each communication token refers to a specific location in the task environment.</li>
            <li>Your task is to learn the semantic meanings of those tokens based the interaction with your AI partner.</li>
            <li>Your compensation is based on <b>task performance</b> (e.g. number of completed trials and steps taken in each trials).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Control</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Parent control: D - go right, A - go left, W - go up, S - go down.</li>
            <li>Child control: select communication contents using buttons on the right side.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
